# sesamo2archimista

This software is designed to ensure "easy" data portability from the Sesamo software to Archimista.

If you don't know them, most probably you don't need to. This stuff is for (italian) professional archivists. Hard-core stuff.

The script generates a .aef file from an adequately formatted .xlsx. The .xlsx must be extracted from Sesamo using it (I have no clue how - ask your archivist friend for this). Right now the script is just a stub, and fails most of the time because of the inherent crazyness of the Excel cell formats and because if you want the easy way, you'd better pay cash up front.

If you happen to have the weird habit of expecting money for work (as most sane people would) and this helps you saving some, please thank Andrea Gelmini - he is the crazy geek who convinced me to release this ugly thing, with the help of my archivist friend (Ivan Faiferri) who was supposed to make money out of it as well. Yeah. So please, send some money to Gelma at least, or maybe a "My little Unix - Kernel is magic!" T-shirt. Hence the license.

Of course, this readme is gratuitous trolling (hi Gelma!). Please enjoy and check back for updates. :)

If you fork this, be sure to *read the license and behave accordingly*.
